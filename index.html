          <h2><strong>Kawhi Anthony Leonard</strong></h2> 
          <h3>(/kəˈwaɪ/, born June 29, 1991)</h3> is an American
          professional basketball player for the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball
          Association (NBA). Leonard played two seasons of college basketball for the San Diego
          State Aztecs and was a consensus second-team All-American as a sophomore. The Indiana
          Pacers selected him with the 15th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft but traded him to the
          San Antonio Spurs the same day. With the Spurs, Leonard won an NBA championship in 2014,
          when he was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). After seven seasons with the
          Spurs, Leonard was traded to the Raptors in 2018. In 2019, he led the Raptors to their
          first NBA championship in franchise history and won his second Finals MVP award. He is a
          three-time All-Star and has two All-NBA first team selections. Nicknamed "The Claw" or
          "The Klaw" for his ball-hawking skills, Leonard has earned five All-Defensive team
          selections and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award in 2015 and 2016.
